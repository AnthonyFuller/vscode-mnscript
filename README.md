# MNScript Extension
Adds Visual Studio Code language support for CivilNetworks' MAXNET scripting language.

## This is currently a WIP

- Currently, the extension only adds basic syntax highlighting.

## Getting Started

You can install the extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AnthonyFuller.mnscript) or the [OpenVSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/AnthonyFuller/mnscript).

Currently, no more setup other than that is required.
